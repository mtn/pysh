# pysh

pysh is a small unix-style shell written in Python! It was inspired by [Destroy All Software #104](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/shell-from-scratch), which featured a similar but slightly smaller shell implemented in Ruby. It features both piping and (standard) redirection. :shell:
